Parcel Delivery API
A secure, modular, and role-based backend API designed to manage a parcel delivery system. This application allows users to register as senders or receivers and perform various operations such as creating, tracking, canceling, or confirming parcel deliveries.

üöÄ Key Features
JWT-Based Authentication: Secure login system using accessToken and cookie-based refreshToken for persistent sessions.

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Endpoints are protected based on user roles (ADMIN, SENDER, RECEIVER), ensuring users can only access authorized resources.

Parcel Management: Senders can create new parcel requests and cancel them before dispatch.

Status Tracking: Admins can update a parcel's status (e.g., REQUESTED, DISPATCHED, IN_TRANSIT, DELIVERED), and users can track these updates in real-time.

User Management: Admins have full control over the user base, including viewing all users and blocking or unblocking their accounts.

Secure Password Hashing: User passwords are securely hashed using bcryptjs before being stored in the database.

Modular Architecture: The codebase is organized into a clean, modular structure, making it easy to maintain, scale, and extend.

Input Validation: All incoming API requests are validated using Zod to ensure data integrity and prevent invalid inputs.

Centralized Error Handling: A global error handler ensures consistent and well-structured error responses across the API.
